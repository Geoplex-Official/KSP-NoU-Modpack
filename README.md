 ## How to install:
 1. Manual installation.
 2. Automatic installation with automatic updates.
 
 #1. Manual installation.
- On the top of this (https://github.com/Toonu/KSP-NoU-Modpack) page is a green button labeled Code, when you click on it, choose download ZIP in the context menu.
- After the file downloads itself, extract its contents into your KSP GameData folder.
- Enjoy the modpack!
 
 #2. Automatic installation
 
- Install git to your computer (preferably GUI version, for example the https://desktop.github.com/ )
- On the top of this (https://github.com/Toonu/KSP-NoU-Modpack) page is a green button labeled Code, when you click on it, copy the HTTPS URL of the repository.
- If you have Git with user interface, find a clone option/button/function and use the copied URL. Choose empty folder for the repository download location.
- After the repository downloads, enable hidden files in your operating system and copy the contents of the folder including the hidden .git folder into your KSP GameData folder.
- Relaunch the git program which would most likely ask you to locate the repository it is missing. Point the program towards your GameData.
- Moving of repository is done and you can enjoy the modpack!

Note: In case you are knowledgeable in git via command line, we are sure you can handle the installation and every update yourself without any guide, hence not providing exact commands.

 ## How to update the mod to latest iteration:
 
- When the modpack gets an update, you get notification in the discord server that a new release has been released.
- After that, you launch the git program once again and fetch/pull origin/master to download the latest changes.
- If it will pop up error, r-click on your changes in the left panel (GitHub desktop-specific approach) and click discard all changes. After that, retry pulling from origin and it will work.
- Note: This only works for automatic installations.
 
 ## How to report an issue:
 
- To report an issue, go to the https://github.com/Toonu/KSP-NoU-Modpack/issues and report issue.
- Try to be maximally descriptive and describe what happened, when and most importantly how, or what different behaviour you expected to happen.
- Please do not make issues that are already there.
- Bring videos or pictures if needed!

## How to contribute to the development:

- If you're familiar with git (or even when you are not), you can make your own changes to the modpack in your GameData and then do a pull-request (Menu Branch > Create a pull request) to the main repository which will go through testing and application process.
