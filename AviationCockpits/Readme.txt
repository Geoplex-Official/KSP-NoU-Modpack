How to install:
Sensually insert the contained file to your Gamedata folder
I also recommend having the newest RasterPropMonitor install
So it looks like this:

GameData

This mod used to be named Mk1 Fighter Cockpits, please delete that so you dont end up with useless junk files.
Thanks to everyone who downloaded, commented, left feedback or reported a bug.

If you want to use contents in your own mod packs, feel free to do so, no need to ask for permission.

If I disappear forever, anyone can take up maintenance or whatever.
