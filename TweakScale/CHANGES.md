# TweakScale :: Changes

* 2020-0303: 2.4.3.11 (Lisias) for KSP >= 1.4.1
	* Adding support for [KSP Recall](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/KSP-Recall), allowing TweakScale to be used on KSP 1.9.x due a new glitch introduced by these KSP versions.
		- Closes issue [#98](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/TweakScale/issues/98)
* 2019-1030: 2.4.3.10 (Lisias) for KSP >= 1.4.1
	+ Lifting the ban on running on KSP 1.8, as the glitch detected proved inoffensive (beside annoying) and was fixed on KSP 1.8.1
	+ Changing install layout for `Scale_Dist.dll` .
		- Needed to prevent being annoyed by Add'On Binder errors.
		- Please read [KNOWN ISSUES](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/TweakScale/blob/master/KNOWN_ISSUES.md) for further information.
